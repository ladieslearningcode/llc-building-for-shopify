      ###Ladies Learning Code: Building a store with Shopify

      <br>
      ##Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Intro (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Today's Goal, creating a partner count, setting up a dev store, uploading products
      * <strong>Themes (11:00 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>: Uploading a theme, changing the theme settings, first class exercise, managing collections
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>Pages (1:30 pm -2:00 pm)</strong>: making pages, creating/editing the navigation menu, the language editor, intro to HTML, breaking the code exercise
      * <strong>Templating (2:00 pm - 2:30 pm)</strong>: Templates & theme structure, intro to liquid objects, liquid filters
      * <strong>Conditionals (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: Hero image exercise, intro to CSS, pseudo code, if statements, discount codes
      * <strong>Wrapping it up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: For-loops, snippets for pagination<br>
      Choose between Exercise #10 and the Bogus Gateway stretch goals if you have time


      <br>
      ##General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files. heck in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.
      * To create a Partner account with Shopify, learners may be asked for PayPal information and their phone number. They will not be charged anything for the creation of the account. A Partner account is used by theme and app developers, so the PayPal information is required for them to earn money!

      Before the class starts, be sure to update the WiFi credentials on slide 1, and your instructor information on slide #112

      <br>
      ##Specific Examples

      <strong>Slide 6: (Shopify Logo)</strong><br>
      Shopify takes care of hosting your files, maintaining a database of your products and sales, and making sure financial transactions are secure - a lot of the obstacles to setting up a viable online business are taken care of. It was started in Ottawa, Ontario.

      <strong>Slide: 7-8 (Brand Logos)</strong><br>
      It's used and trusted by many well known and popular brands.

      <strong>Slide 9: Today's Goal</strong><br>
      Liquid is a Ruby-based coding language that was created by Shopify.
      It is predominately a "templating language".

      <strong>Slide 13: Shopify Partner Account</strong><br>
      The Shopify Partners program is a way to earn some client revenue and get access to additional resources. It's also useful for people just starting out because it lets you create development shops and work on them as long as you'd like before you're ready to "go live".

      <strong>Slide 14: I'm a Partner now. What does that mean?</strong><br>
      When you "finish" a dev shop, you can transfer it to a merchant and from there it's up to the merchant whether you will still have access. You can make revenue by setting up stores for people who become Shopify merchants, when people buy the themes you've designed, or lease the the Apps you've made.

      <strong>Slide 17: Edit Product screenshot</strong><br>
      After they have refreshed the page, ask them to click on any product to see the screen on this slide.

      <strong>Slide 18: Uploading CSV file</strong><br>
      Depending on the size of your inventory, importing files from a CSV can be simpler to maintain then adding each product manually through the Shopify interface. Some people are more familiar and comfortable with applications that write CSV files to speed up the data entry process.

      <strong>Slide 19: (No title, product detail screenshot)</strong><br>
      Point out how detailed the description is in the product details. It's helpful to think of the kinds of words people would search for when looking for an item, and using those keywords in the body of the description. Eg. materials, methods of production, fit/shape.

      Click on the view button and walk the class through some of the common
      product page elements:
      <ul>
        <li>Tags - Add as many as you want, can be used for sorting</li>
        <li>Multiple images</li>
        <li>Compare at price - how to tell Shopify if an item is on sale</li>
        <li>Inventory policy - Can tell whether you want Shopify to keep track of the inventory.</li>
        <li>SEO: What it's going to look like for search engines</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Slide 26: Exercise #1: Get to know your theme</strong><br>
      Do the first couple changes with the class, then leave this list up.

      Give class time to experiment with edits, mentors can help them go through the list.

      <strong>Slide 30: MULIPLE CONDITIONS COLLECTIONS</strong><br>
      If the learners can't guess the answer to this on their own, emphasize the difference between 'and' and 'or'.

      <strong> Slide 42:</strong><br>
      This may be the first time a learner has seen HTML. Take a moment to point out the pair of tags and what the tags in this example mean.

      <strong>Slide 43: How does liquid help?</strong><br>

      Explain that {{ }} are called handlebars - they are pretty common with templating languages.

      <strong>Slide 54: Break smarter</strong><br>
      The ability to make duplicates and easily switch between them is a huge advantage with Shopify. Mistakes are less costly than with some other content management systems.

      <strong>Slide 57: (Template image)</strong><br>
      There are a lot of parts to a website, but you only need to work in small chunks at a time. Breaking up a big problem into smaller, manageable chunks is an essential part of computational thinking!

      <strong>Slide 60: Layout</strong><br>
      Differantiate a theme from a template. A theme is a collection of template files.

      <strong>Slide 65: Exercise #4: Intro to liquid objects</strong><br>
      Briefly discuss the importance of referencing and reading documentation. Memorization is not as important as knowing how to look up the information you need.
      Remind class it's about incremental steps - instead of trying to do everything at once, make a small change, the preview the result.

      <strong>Slide 71: Types of filters</strong><br>
      This is their first time seeing an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, so briefly explain what this is since they will be creating one of their own soon.

      <strong>Slide 75: Exercise #6</strong><br>
      Explain what a "hero" image is.

      <strong>Slide 77: Exercise #6</strong><br>
      Suggestion - they can keep the code editor, and the Shopify dashboard open in 2 separate tabs so they can switch between them. Otherwise they may need help reminding themselves how to go back to the code editor.

      <strong>Slide 82: Screenshots of masthead images, with one broken</strong>
      Some collections don't have hero images, so those will show a blank area where the image would be.

      <strong>Slide 89: Exercise #6</strong><br>
      See if you can get the class to give you the answer to the three questions.
      Let learners work out the for-loop and the if-statement on their own/with a mentor.

      <strong>Slide 93: Introducing the For-loop</strong><br>
      See if you can get the class to give you the answer to the questions without you helping them along.

      <strong>Slide 109: FINAL EXERCISE: DO SOME SHOPPING</strong><br>
      Click on the 'Bogus payment gateway' link and follow the steps along with the documentation for the class to follow. They may be asked during checkout to provide their phone number.
